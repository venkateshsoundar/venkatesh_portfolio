## ATS Resume Checker

A Streamlit tool to compare a resume against a job description and estimate an ATS score.
Upload a PDF resume and paste the job description to see keyword matches, missing terms, and generate an ATSâ€‘optimized version of the resume.

To enable resume tailoring, place an OpenRouter API key in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

This feature is available below the chat bot in the main portfolio app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

You can also run just the checker:

```bash
streamlit run ats_tool.py
```
